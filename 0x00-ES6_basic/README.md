# ES6 Basics

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

1. **What ES6 is**: 
   ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is the sixth edition of the ECMAScript language specification. It introduces significant enhancements and new features to JavaScript, making it more powerful and expressive.

2. **New features introduced in ES6**:
   - Arrow functions
   - Classes
   - Template literals
   - Destructuring assignment
   - let and const keywords for variable declaration
   - Spread and rest operators
   - Promises for asynchronous programming
   - And more

3. **The difference between a constant and a variable**:
   - Constants (declared using `const`) cannot be reassigned once they are initialized.
   - Variables (declared using `let`) can be reassigned after initialization.

4. **Block-scoped variables**:
   - Variables declared with `let` and `const` are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block they are declared in.

5. **Arrow functions and function parameters default to them**:
   - Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing function expressions.
   - They inherit the `this` value from the enclosing lexical context.
   - Function parameters can have default values, which are used when no argument is passed.

6. **Rest and spread function parameters**:
   - The rest parameter (`...`) allows functions to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array.
   - The spread operator (`...`) allows an iterable (like an array) to be expanded into individual elements.

7. **String templating in ES6**:
   - Template literals (enclosed in backticks ``) allow for easy string interpolation and multiline strings.
   - They can contain placeholders (`${}`) for inserting variables or expressions.

8. **Object creation and their properties in ES6**:
   - Object literals can be created using a simpler syntax with shorthand property names and methods.
   - Computed property names allow for dynamic property keys.
   - Object destructuring allows for extracting properties from objects into variables.

9. **Iterators and for-of loops**:
   - Iterators are objects that define a sequence of values and a mechanism for iterating over them.
   - The `for-of` loop iterates over iterable objects (like arrays, strings, or maps) and executes a block of code for each iteration.
